Mechanochemical Energy Landscapes Under Force Support Catch–Slip Bonds in T-Cell Activation"

This repository contains the computational code used to reproduce the
results in the manuscript. MATLAB scripts compute stationary points,
effective potentials, Hessians, and eigenvalues. The Mathematica notebook
generates the figures used in the paper (energy landscapes, barriers,
and bond lifetimes).
